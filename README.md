# LoadBalancer
This a load Balancer test where I have try to create a load Balancer in rust then see if I could AI promote my way into chatgpt 4 creating one. The LoadBalancerWeb is used for endPoint basically when you connect start up angular it will http call and put it port number in a Array on the load balancer. Then when you http the load balancer get end point it will redirect one of them.
